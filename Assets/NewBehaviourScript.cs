        Obi - Wan: It's over, Anakin! I have the high ground!

        Anakin: You underestimate my power.

        Obi - Wan: Don't try it. I have the High ground!

        (Anakin angrily attempts to jump out of the raft and hit Obi - Wan on the high ground, only to get his legs and left arm chopped off.Anakin then drops his lightsaber, rolls of the high ground and lands near the lava.)

        Obi - Wan: You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them! I still have the High ground!

        Anakin: I hate you and your high ground!

        Obi - Wan: You were my brother, Anakin!I love you, along with the High ground!

         (Anakin catches fire and screams.)

        Obi - Wan: Whoops.I better grab that there. (grabs Anakin's lightsaber while on the high ground) High ground.

         Anakin: Wait.Are you f * cking robbing me ?

        Obi - Wan : I'll give it to your son someday if Padme isn't, you know, dead.I mean, she looked pretty dead to me, from up here... on the high ground.

         Anakin: (with a COMPLETELY scarred face) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.Uh, I'm literally just c-cooking to death. Please just kill me.

        Obi - Wan: That's not the high ground wa-- I mean, the Jedi way. You know what I'm saying. I'm saying I've beaten you, and I'm on the high ground, so... High ground.

        Some - Rando: Props to whoever made this, this made my day.high ground!~
